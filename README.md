# Welcome!

## About me
My primary research interest is generating insights from large biological datasets. My expertise is specifically in understanding how gene expression is regulated in mammalian cells.

These days, I’m learning all about canine genetics while working as a Senior Scientist in epigenetics at [Embark Vet](https://embarkvet.com/). I’m very excited to use my genomics training to improve dog (and human!) health.

## Previous research
My previous position was as a post-doctoral researcher in [John Lis‘s group](https://blogs.cornell.edu/johnlislab/) in the Department of Molecular Biology & Genetics at Cornell University. I used systems biology approaches to investigate how chromatin accessibility and protein binding in different cell types impact how small molecules alter enhancer activity (see the pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.444518v1.full). I also [optimized an assay](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.102277v1) for identifying changes in transcription, and wrote a highly cited review on [profiling nascent RNAs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31399713/).

Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher with [Tracy Johnson](https://johnsonlab.mcdb.ucla.edu/) in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at UCLA. There, I researched the interplay between chromatin and co-transcriptional splicing in macrophages as part of the Ribonomics collaboration. A paper from our group is available [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36424375/).

I received my PhD in the field of Biochemistry, Molecular, & Cellular Biology at Cornell University from work I performed in [Andrew Grimson‘s lab](https://www.grimsonlab.com/). My research included:
- [Identifying sequences](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26941072/) needed for post-transcriptional gene regulation,
- Understanding how [microRNA regulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26416483/) changes during [mammalian development](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28034872/), and
- Discovering the role of a (microRNA in the immune system)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26549197/].

## Skills
I have extensive expertise with mammalian tissue culture, molecular biology, analyzing high-throughput sequencing data (mRNA, miRNAs, nascent RNAs, ChIP, and ATAC), and using Python and R. I am also experienced with accessing databases using SQL and using AWS for cloud computing.
I've taken relevant coursework at Cornell (Applied Bioinformatics) and the [UCLA Collaboratory](https://qcb.ucla.edu/collaboratory/), as well as earned a [DataCamp certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DSA0019646217756) in Data Science with Python.
